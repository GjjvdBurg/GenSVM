/**
 * @brief Calculate the time between two time recordings
 *
 * @details
 * This function should be used with time recordings done by 
 * gensvm_set_time(). To do this easily the Timer() macro has been defined in 
 * the header file.  Example usage:
 *
 * @code
 * struct timespec start, stop;
 * Timer(start);
 * // do some work //
 * Timer(stop);
 * double duration = gensvm_elapsed_time(&start, &stop);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This approach to measuring time has been chosen since CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW 
 * is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing, and is not affected by leap 
 * seconds or other changes to the system clock. It is therefore thread-safe 
 * and can be used to accurately measure time intervals.
 *
 * @param[in] 	start 	starting time
 * @param[in] 	stop 	end time
 * @returns 		time elapsed in seconds
